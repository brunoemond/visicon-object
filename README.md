# visicon-object class and methods

The **visicon-object class and methods** is a software module designed to work with the ACT-R cognitive architecture, providing an interface for managing visual feature representations of CLOS objects in the ACT-R visicon. 

## Overview

The core component of the module is the `visicon-object` class, which encapsulates the properties and behaviors of individual visual objects for the visicon.

## Features

- **Add Visual Objects**
  - Create new instances in the visicon with specified attributes, such as shape, color, and position.
- **Modify Visual Objects**
  - Update the attributes of existing visual objects dynamically, supporting real-time adjustments.
- **Delete Visual Objects**
  - Remove specific objects from the visicon, reflecting environmental changes in the simulation.

## Purpose

The **visicon-object class and methods** simplifies interaction with ACT-Râ€™s visual feature creation functions.

The software includes the visicon-object class which support the definition of custom objects that will be represented in the visicon. 
 
```lisp
   ;;; visicon methods
   (add-to-visicon visicon-object)
   (add-to-visicon list-of-visicon-objects)
   (modify-visicon visicon-object)
   (delete-from-visicon visicon-object)
   (delete-from-visicon list-of-visicon-objects)

   ;;; chunk-type definition methods ***
   (visual-location-chunk-type class-name)
   (visual-object-chunk-type class-name)
```

## Examples

- The visicon-object.lisp file defines a function to demonstrate the core functionality of the software.

- The examples/adjust-visicon-features-modified.lisp file contains annotated and adapted code for the visicon-object class and methods. The original code can be found at this logical pathname location: "ACT-R:examples;vision-module;adjust-visicon-features.lisp".
